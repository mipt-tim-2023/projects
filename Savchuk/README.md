## Analysis of a csv-table of large projects from YC

You can view the analysis in detail on the notebook <code>parse_yc_csv.ipynb</code>.

В этой таблице были собраны данные по проектам, выпущенным из YC, имеющие высокую стоимость. По результатам похожего на предыдущий случай анализа, были получены следующие результаты:
