### Project description

In this project my goal is to analyze data of YC investments and to try to find some dependencies amongst the mentioned data. The figures I am mostly interested in are Deal Size and Acquired % of the company. I use different statistical criterions to prove that there are significant impact between Deal Type or tags of the company and acquired % of the company.

### Results

I have managed to find, that there are significant differences in Deal Size between Early VC, Later VC and Seed Round with  Later VC stage gaining much more money than thr previous two. Also I have used joined table (credits: Kirill456z) of deals' information and companys' tags on YC to analyse the same hypothesis based on tags. However, there were too many tags, so I have grouped them into 6 categories, and using mupltipletests I have found out significant differences only in % Acquired between tags of Business and Finance category vs Energy and Ecology, and also between  Energy and Ecology vs Commerce.
